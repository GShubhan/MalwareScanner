# NoVirus - Scan your system with not 1, not 2 but 70 AntiVirus softwares 
I am school student learning Python and C as part of my Computer Science subject. 
This scanner works using Virus Total API and check for new files in C:\Download folder against known malware hashes.


We will Get a file report by hash: given a {md5} hash, retrieve the pertinent analysis report including threat reputation and context produced by 70+ antivirus products, 10+ dynamic analysis sandboxes and a myriad of other security tools and datasets.
Program will generate an alert with number of scanners detected file as malicious in the form of Pie-Chart

There are more enhancements possible - for future :)
  1. remove ( or zip the malicious file )
  2. run this program with daemon to check every 5 min for new files
  3. Upload files not found on the VT ( ask user before uploading - Privacy )

*****Happy safe surfing, Be stamrt on the internet*****
