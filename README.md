# MalwareScanner
I am school student learning Python and C as part of my Computer Science subject. 
This scanner works using Virus Total API and check for new files downloaded against known malware hashes.
I intend to write python or C code to accomplish this.

We will use Get a file report by hash: given a {md5, sha1, sha256} hash, retrieves the pertinent analysis report including threat reputation and context produced by 70+ antivirus products, 10+ dynamic analysis sandboxes and a myriad of other security tools and datasets.
